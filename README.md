# Overview:
## The Problem:
Many people drive cars to school or work and that generates a staggering 20% of greenhouse gas emissions.

## The Solution:
The application will encourage students to take public transportation thus making an impact by reducing 
the amount of people driving cars and will help students in difference campuses find public transportation 
easier. U-Link will be a transportation app giving students real time bus tracking information and at the 
same time will have a leaderboard and chatroom for students to interact with each other. This makes it 
not only a transportation app but also a social networking app for students. 

## Target Audience
U-Link is tailored specifically for students who rely on public transit and are looking for a more connected 
and seamless commuting experience.
